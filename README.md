## How to play

- the arrows at the bottom let you control the movement of your snake.
- The snake is moving faster and faster over time.
- You have to eat a lot of these red Dots, to get higher score.
- Sometimes orange dots appear, they are better then the red dots because they provide more score, but they disapear after some time so you must be fast.
- As any traditional snake game, don't let the face of the snake touch neither the rest of his body, nor the walls.
- Try to beat your friends by getting higher scores then them.
